## Bug Classes

### Time of check to time of use

Time of check to time of use \(TOCTOU\) bugs are classes of bugs in which access or permissions to a resource are verified independently of their actual use.  In cases like this it requires something that the user can modify independently of the process.  

A classic example is that of the access to fopen call in C.
