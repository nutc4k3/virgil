# Stack Based

I've already written quite extensively about stack-based buffer overflows, and I will link to the three posts I wrote on this subject.  Some of this content will be migrated over to this gitbook, but I recommend giving them a read as a comprehensive introduction:

[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux - Chapter 1](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-1.html)  
[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux 2 - Using GDB](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-2.html)  
[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux 3 - Bypassing DEP with ROP](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-3.html)

Currently a large amount of this focuses on Linux based attacks but I will aim to add more Windows based stuff in the future.
