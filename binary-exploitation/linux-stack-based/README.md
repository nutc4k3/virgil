# Linux Stack Based

I've already written quite extensively about stack-based buffer overflows, and I will link to the three posts I wrote on this subject.  A large amount of their content will however slowly be migrated over to this gitbook:

[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux - Chapter 1](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-1.html)  
[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux 2 - Using GDB](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-2.html)  
[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux 3 - Bypassing DEP with ROP](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-3.html)
