# Linux Stack Based

I've already written quite extensively about stack-based buffer overflows, and rather than duplicate effort I will link to the three posts I wrote on this subject:

[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux - Chapter 1](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-1.html)

[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux 2 - Using GDB](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-2.html)

[Stack Buffer Overflows: Linux 3 - Bypassing DEP with ROP](https://reboare.github.io/bof/linux-stack-bof-3.html)
