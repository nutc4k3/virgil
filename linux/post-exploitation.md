## debugfs Kernel Module

Described by Nick Bulischeck in [Misusing debugfs for In-Memory RCE](https://nbulischeck.io/posts/misusing-debugfs-for-in-memory-rce).  Code for his backdoor is available on [Github](https://github.com/nbulischeck/debugfs-backdoor).  This can be used quite effectively to maintain persistence when elevated to root.
