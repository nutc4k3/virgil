# OS Agnostic

This section details exploits, vulnerabilities and general enumeration techniques that can be found on any OS version, such as in the case of language interpreters. This technically would encompass web-vulnerabilities but since that topic is so broad it has been given it's own section.

I will attempt to be as extensive as possible in my examples, but in some cases it may be necessary to give them for a single operating system.
