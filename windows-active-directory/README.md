# Windows Active Directory

> A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network. A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information.
