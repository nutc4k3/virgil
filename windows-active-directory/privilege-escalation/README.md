# Privilege Escalation

Most of Active Directory Privilege Escalation is mostly horizontal and rather than escalating from a regular User to Domain Admin, involves performing reconnaisance and slowly building up an image of the domain.  From this, high value targets can be identified and by slowly taking over more and more of the directory a route through the domain can be identified.

This is also devoted to the Active Directory structure itself.  If you're interested in attacking a Windows OS that happens to be in an Active Directory environment, then [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://booj.gitbook.io/virgil/~/edit/primary/windows-active-directory/privilege-escalation) is likely to be of more use.
